    Provides the base class and ParserElement base class to do initial parsing on the MsgObject.<br>
    <br>
     ParserElement is a Java class that implements a few methods
    <ul>
      <li>
        preProcess()
      </li>
      <li>
        process()
      </li>
      <li>
        postProcess()
      </li>
      <li>
        a few others
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
     Also contains a Hashtable to store name/value pairs (actually, it has a MsgObject and uses the enhanced hashtable found in there). <br>
     Key method is process() - it understands the grammar and how to parse it into name/value pairs and stores them in the Hashtable <br>
    <blockquote>
      Table:OAGCOMMON~Field:FLIGHTNO~Order:1 becomes:<br>
       Table = OAGCOMMON<br>
       Field = FLIGHTNO<br>
       Order = 1
    </blockquote>
    <br>
     Pre- and Post- process allow additional changes to be made for special cases <br>
     Process can be overwritten to do other special processing as well <br>
     <br>
     The MraldParser uses the list of ParserElements is in parser.props file to determine which name/value pairs in the MsgObject to process.
