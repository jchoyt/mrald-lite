Instructions for Installing The MRALD War File with Tomcat 4.1.x

(While not the best example, these steps are for use with a Windows-based system.  More confirmation is needed for the instructions to work with an UNIX based system)

1) Install Java
	- Download the latest SDK from http://java.sun.com (at print time, j2sdk1.4.2_01
	- Follow the on screen instructions to install or unzip the package
	- After the installation is complete:
		~ add the bin directory in the Java directory to your system variable, PATH
		~`add a system variable, JAVA_HOME


2) Install Tomcat 4.1.x
	- Download the latest version of Tomcat 4.1.x from http://jakarta.apache.org (at print time, Tomcat 4.1.18)
	- Follow the instructions to install or unzip the package to your computer
	- (SECURITY) Erase the examples directory from the webapps directory
	- To comfirm correct installation, start Tomcat from the bin\startup.bat file and navigate to localhost:8080


3) Shutdown Tomcat with the shutdown.bat file in the bin directory


4) In order for the system to work, you must have our simplest of schema setup in your database
	- Use this SQL:

CREATE TABLE People (
        peopleId             NUMBER(3) NOT NULL,
        surname              VARCHAR2(50) NULL,
        firstName            VARCHAR2(50) NULL,
        titleRank            VARCHAR2(50) NULL,
        phone                VARCHAR2(20) NULL,
        email                VARCHAR2(50) NULL,
        peopleTypeId         NUMBER(3) NULL
);


	- The peopleTypeId identifies the user's level ( 1 is standard, 3 is adminstrator)


5) Copy the ROOT.war file into the {TOMCAT}\webapps directory and delete everything else
	- Go to the {TOMCAT}\bin directory and start the startup.bat file
	- This will unpack and place everything from the WAR in the right place
	- navigate to localhost:8080 and you will see the "Administrative Configuration" page
		~ Confirm the DB specific variables (i.e. DBSERVER, DBLOGIN, DBPASSWORD....)
		~ Change the SMTP Server and the Email Address to your satisfaction
		~ Check to make sure the BasePath is correct (should be the location of your webapps folder)


Good to go!
