        <h1>MRALD Cookie Policy</h1>
<div class=faq>
	Because of the sensitivity and security of the data, the MRALD system has been
	forced to use an authenication system, which includes the use of cookies.  Each 
	time you visit this system, you will be required to log in with your validated 
	email and password. Once authenicated, a session with be created in your 
	browser and a cookie will be placed on your machine. The only data stored on 
	your computer will be your email address, and this only information will be 
	transferred to MRALD.  Although	only a small amount of information is transferred
	to the system, it is critical for the system work correctly and effectively. As
	a result, your session will time out from inactivity and you will be forced to
	re-authenicate yourself.<BR>
        <BR>
        What will we do with this?   Some data suppliers have restrictions on how the 
	data supplied can be used. We also require a security log be kept of all acccess
	and operation so issues and problems can be tracked down with relative ease.
	The cookie placed on your machine is not a tracking or spyware cookie because it 
	is only accessed or relevant to this specific MRALD system.
