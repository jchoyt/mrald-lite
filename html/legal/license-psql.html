<h1>BSD License</h1>

<p>
      The PostgreSQL JDBC driver is distributed under the BSD license, same
      as the server.  The simplest explanation of the licensing terms is that
      you can do whatever you want with the product and source code as long
      as you don't claim you wrote it or sue us.  You should give it a read
      though, it's only half a page.
    </p>
