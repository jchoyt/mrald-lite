                    The page title is the phrase that will appear in multiple places in the MRALD 
                    system after the form has been created.  Although it is only a line in the xml 
                    file, the page title will appear both as the title and header of the created 
                    form as well as the text for the link to the form from the main page.  In 
                    addition, if you desire to 'bookmark' or add the page to your 'favorites', the 
                    page title will also appear as the name of the bookmark.

                    search and the related results?</FONT></B> <BR>
                    <P CLASS="response">
                    The depth of the related table search is the number of joins that the database 
                    will use to determine the relationship between a set of tables.  The results of 
                    the query will be based on the tables linked to the ones checked within <I><B>n</B></I> 
                    joins. <I>( n being the depth entered )</I>  If the structure of the table 
                    relationship is such that a shallow depth produces a relatively large number of 
                    tables, the succeeding step in the form builder may take longer than expected.

                    Each row of this table represents a specific table or view in the database.  The 
                    checkbox allows the user to carry the specified table over to the next Form 
                    Builder step.  The center column is the system name for the table and the far 
                    right column represents the system comments for the table.  These comments are 
                    filled in by the database administrator when the table are created.  No comments 
                    will be displayed as <I>null</I>.
