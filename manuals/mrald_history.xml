      Form Builder refined enough to release to users, and users
      can share their forms with other users. Later in the month,
      the system plays an integral part in determining who within
      MITRE had access to ETMS flight data after the terrorist
      attack of 9/11/01</para>

      Released DirectQuery for public use. This facility had been
      in use by the developers and many of the more knowledgeable
      users for quite some time. Also wrote a facility for
      uploading many queries at once (direct query upload)</para>

      First really good, successful customization with new work
      flows. Added a work flow step to modify queries adding in
      clues for the query optimizer to use when querying large
      data sets. This resulted in a 50 to 99% decrease in query
      execution time. Also added personal query history, some
      enhanced widgets, and filter operators for NULLs in the
      database</para>

                  Feedback is given to the user building the form
                  on why a form is invalid and how to fix it. A
                  valid form has a single, acyclic join path
                  between all tables on the form</para>

                <listitem>
                  <para>New exception handling facility. Two new
                  classes provide a consistent error handling
                  philosophy taking into account the
                  opportunities the MRALD architecture provides
                  and the chained exception facility of Java 1.4.
                  Over the next few releases, all MRALD classes
                  will be retrofitted to take advantage of this
                  facility. These new exception handling classes
                  also provide more detailed output when a
                  problem occurs, making diagnostics and
                  debugging easier</para>

                  passwords for users to log in. If you want to
                  disable this, you'll have to recompile MRALD
                  with the Config.usingSecurity property set to
                  false. Note that existing deployments will have
                  to add a "password" column to their people
                  table; type is VARCHAR(50).</para>

                  <para>Improved Security Measures. The system
                  was restructured to enable the web server to
                  run under the JVM security manager. This allows
                  SSL connections as well as strict restrictions
                  on system access from the JVM. Users now must
                  provide a password in order to login to the
                  MRALD system. There also exists facilities to
                  retrieve, change, and register
                  passwords.</para>

                  (assumed to be the administrator who installed
                  it), a setup page will allow the user to change
                  the configuration properties. MRALD also will
                  now create the critical People table in your
                  database if it has not already been
                  created.</para>

                <para>Extreme load testing and resulting changes
                ensure that MRALD is a highly scalable system
                that can operate under extreme loads with many
                concurrent users.</para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>New look and simple forms. MRALD has a new
                look and feel throughout. In addition, data
                retrieval forms now come in two flavors - simple
                and advanced. The advanced forms are identical in
                functionality to the old forms. The simple forms
                retrieve a set number of data fields (those that
                are defaulted when building the form), there are
                no statistical functions, and output is html
                only. All explicitly built filters are inlcuded,
                but none of the generic ones are.</para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>New keyword search features a search
                throughout the entire database for a single word
                or phrase. The search is case sensitive and
                checkes only the text fields in the database. The
                result is a list of all tables where the word
                appears and all the rows in the table that
                contain the word.</para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>New Drill down output type. This output
                type will provide links for all primary or
                foreign keys in your query. Following these links
                will take the user to all data linked directly
                off that table. Works only from MRALD forms -
                doesn't work off DirectQuery.</para>

                <para>Added documentation for the form of common
                JDBC connection strings to help in initial setup.
                Notes and links were added to initial setup pages
                as well as when editing config.properties from
                the interface.</para>

              <listitem>
                <para>Split out the config.properties into two
                files. &nbsp;config.properties contains all the
                things that are normally changed;
                standard.properties contains properties that
                should only be changed if you really know what
                you are doing. It is optional, so if you keep all
                your settings in config.properties, it's
                OK.</para>

                <para>New filter type - Categorical filters. A
                categorical filter is one where the values are
                from a small, known set. This filter will grab
                the values from a database and present them to
                the user in the form of a drop down box.</para>
